                  <h2>AFTERCARE FOLLOWING COMPOSITE VENEER</h2>
                  <p>
                    The care of bonded teeth is no different from the care of
                    normal teeth. Just like our teeth, it is very important to
                    brush bonded teeth regularly and use dental floss every day.
                    To minimize stain formation, it is necessary to stay away
                    from colored foods and drinks as much as possible,
                    especially in the first 48 hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Composite filling is not as strong as natural teeth. For
                    this reason, you should not break hard objects (such as
                    hazelnuts, peanuts) with your restored tooth. You also need
                    to give up habits such as nail biting and pencil biting.
                    Regular care of the teeth and regular check-ups by the
                    dentist will prolong the life of the treatment. For this
                    reason, you should not neglect your routine oral care and
                    routine medical check-ups. During these checks, your
                    composite fillings may also need to be polished again.

                  <p>
                    As with any surgical procedure inside the mouth, hot food
                    and drinks should be avoided to control bleeding and not be
                    spit out after the operation. Smoking should be stopped if
                    possible or smoked as little as possible, as it will impair
                    the healing of the wound area. Teeth adjacent to the wound
                    area should be cleaned with soft-tipped brushes and the
                    cleaning of the area should be supported with antiseptic
                    mouthwashes.

                  <p>
                    The fact that implants are titanium and do not pose a risk
                    of decay does not mean that they will require less care.
                    Just like natural teeth, they should be carefully brushed
                    twice a day and dental floss or an interdental brush should
                    be used. In cases where oral hygiene is neglected, bone
                    resorption and inflammation of the soft tissue may occur
                    around the implant. In such a case, you should immediately
                    consult a dentist and receive the necessary intervention.
                    Otherwise, this may result in implant loss.

                  <h2>Same Day Teeth Implant Post-Operative Advice</h2>
                  <p>
                    Take any painkillers and antibiotics that have been advised
                    by your dentist as required. DO NOT RINSE for several hours
                    as this can disturb initial healing. After this, rinse your
                    mouth with Blue M mouthwash as recommended by your dentist.
                    Avoid smoking, exercise or operation of machinery for the
                    next week. Try to stick to fluids only for the rest of the
                    day and then follow a soft diet for the next 3 months. Do
                    not drink anything alcoholic for the first week following
                    surgery. You may experience some swelling or discomfort for
                    the first few days after the procedure. As the swelling goes
                    down you may have some bruising to the face and neck. This
                    is normal. Contact the practice if any pain persists or
                    worsens, if swelling persists or worsens or if the bleeding
                    persists. Do not try to ‘scrub’ your new teeth. Gently bathe
                    your mouth with the mouthwash. Our hygienist will
                    demonstrate the cleaning needed at your review appointment.
                    Sleep with an extra pillow to lift your head for the first
                    2/3 nights and cover your pillow with an old towel. Ice
                    packs can be held over the area for 20/30 minutes to reduce
                    swelling.

                  <h2>AFTERCARE FOLLOWİNG SCALİNG AND ROOT PLANİNG</h2>
                  <p>
                    Try to avoid really cold liquids and foods and spicy food
                    for a few days or more after the scaling and root planing is
                    performed. If needed, you can use desensitizing toothpastes,
                    such as Sensodyne® to help reduce the sensitivity. Take an
                    over-the-counter analagesic such as ibuprofen before your
                    local anesthesia wears off. Later, you can take the same
                    medication if you have any tenderness of the gums. If you
                    must avoid these analgesics because you are already taking
                    NSAID's, are allergic to them, or you have ulcers, then you
                    may take paracetamol. Please follow dosage recommendations
                    on the product labels. You may rinse with warm salt water as
                    often as you wish after 24 hours. Stir no more than 1/4
                    teaspoonful of table salt into a cup of warm water to use as
                    your rinse solution, this will help soothe any gum tissues
                    that may be tender after the root planing procedure.
                    Alternate between this and Chlorhexidine (Corsodyl mouthwash
                    0.2%). It is important to maintain good plaque control to
                    promote optimal healing after scaling and root planing or
                    surgical therapy. You may also gently massage the areas
                    treated with your washed fingers. This will increase
                    circulation and promote healing. Long-term maintenance -
                    Once you have had your course of ‘deep cleaning’ you will
                    still need to have regular hygiene maintenance appointments,
                    usually at 3-4 month intervals. This is so that we can
                    remove any deposits and try to prevent them from causing
                    further problems to the gums.

                  <h2>AFTERCARE FOLLOWING NEW DENTURE</h2>
                  <p>
                    Wearing a denture for the first time can feel very strange
                    but be reassured it will start to feel more ‘normal’ over
                    time. Wear your denture at home to get used to it, and to
                    build up your confidence. If it becomes sore after a few
                    hours, take it out and have a rest from it. If you find your
                    denture is too uncomfortable to wear, or is causing ulcers
                    in your mouth, contact the surgery to arrange an appointment
                    with the dentist so that your denture can be adjusted and
                    made more comfortable for you. It is advisable to leave your
                    denture out at night, this allows your mouth, particularly
                    the soft tissues of your mouth to have a rest from the
                    denture. When you are not wearing your denture, leave it
                    soaking in water, this will prevent it from drying out. When
                    you clean the denture use a toothbrush and either denture
                    cream or antibacterial liquid soap, whichever you prefer. It
                    is best to carry out the cleaning of your denture over a
                    bowl of water so that if you drop it, it won’t break! You
                    may want to use a denture fixative such as Fixodent or
                    Polygrip to help keep your denture secure. To use any type
                    of denture fixative, follow the instructions provided with
                    the product you are using. When eating with your new denture
                    start with a reasonably soft diet for a week or two, as your
                    confidence in your denture grows, you can progress to eating
                    slightly tougher, crunchy foods. You may notice a change in
                    your speech when wearing a new denture; this is short lived,
                    and will go back to normal within a few days. Food particles
                    can become trapped under dentures causing inflammation or
                    sore spots. Lightly brush the roof of your mouth, your
                    tongue, and your gums after removing your dentures.

                    In most cases, your tooth will feel tender for around 48
                    hours after treatment. This bruised sensation can best be
                    managed by ibuprofen or paracetamol, unless you have been
                    advised by your doctor not to take either of them. If after

                  <h3>Following Tooth Preparation:</h3>
                  <p>
                    Sensitivity and tenderness of the tooth and surrounding gums
                    is common for the first day or two after a tooth has been
                    prepared for a restoration. If the tenderness or sensitivity
                    lasts longer than this, please contact our office. If
                    anesthesia is used, avoid chewing, biting, and eating until
                    the numbness wears off. The final restoration may be placed
                    the same day that the tooth is prepared or may be placed
                    during a separate appointment.
                  </p>
                  <h3>For Temporary Restorations:</h3>
                  <p>
                    Eat softer foods, and avoid foods that are particularly
                    crunchy, chewy, or hard. Carefully clean around the
                    restoration, brushing and flossing daily. Be gentle when
                    flossing, taking extra care not to loosen the temporary
                    restoration. Slowly pulling the floss out by one end can
                    help avoid putting too much pressure on the temporary.

                  <h3>After Final Restoration Placement:</h3>
                  <p>
                    Avoid chewing on hard, crunchy, or sticky foods for 24 hours
                    in order to give time for the cement to fully bond. Mild
                    sensitivity to hot or cold foods is not unusual and should
                    dissipate after a few weeks. If sensitivity lasts more than
                    six weeks, please let the office know.

                  <p>
                    Proper care of your restoration includes brushing your teeth
                    after every meal and snack, and flossing at least once a day
                    before bedtime. Rinsing your mouth with water or mouthwash
                    with also help to remove any additional particles that may
                    have been missed during brushing and flossing. Please call
